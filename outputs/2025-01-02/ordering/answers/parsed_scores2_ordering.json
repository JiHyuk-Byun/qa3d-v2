It is less detailed and artistic compared to Image 1 and Image 2, and does not exhibit the noise or artifacts seen in Image 4 and Image 5. Therefore, it fits well between the third and fourth example images, considering its clean structure and simplicity.\n\nIndex: 3",
                "The target image features a clean and well-defined geometric design with minimal texturing artifacts, placing it above examples with low-poly or noisy structures, like Image 2 and Image 4. It maintains clarity and simplicity better than Image 4, which appears fragmented. However, it lacks the detailed texture and complexity seen in the top examples like Image 0 and Image 1.\n\nIndex: 2"
