Its form is straightforward and lacks the complexity or detail expected in highly plausible 3D objects that resemble real-world counterparts. The proportions and contours are accurate for a button but do not exhibit advanced features of realism in contours or textures.\n\nScore: 2",
                "The model appears to have a basic and simplistic shape, resembling a flower button. While the shape is clear, the lack of intricate details or textures gives it a less realistic appearance. The proportions are consistent with its simple design, but the overall realism and complexity seem limited.\n\nScore: 2"
