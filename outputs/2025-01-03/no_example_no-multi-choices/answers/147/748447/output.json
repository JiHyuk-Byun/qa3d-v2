Evaluate the structure of the wings, tail, and body. Check for any exaggerated or unrealistic features that might detract from its plausibility as a believable creature.\n\n### Example Scoring\n- **Score 1 (Very Poor)**: The model lacks basic structure and realism, with glaring inaccuracies in proportions and shape.\n- **Score 2 (Poor)**: Some features may resemble a dragon, but major structural issues make it look unrealistic.\n- **Score 3 (Border)**: The model has basic dragon-like qualities but lacks detail or has minor proportion issues.\n- **Score 4 (Good)**: The model is mostly realistic with minor inaccuracies. Shapes and structures closely resemble a dragon.\n- **Score 5 (Very Good)**: The model is highly realistic with accurate proportions, shapes, and excellent attention to detail.\n\nPlease evaluate based on these guidelines to determine the appropriate score.",
