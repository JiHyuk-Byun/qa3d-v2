Look for any blurriness or stretching.\n3. **Material Quality:** Evaluate if the materials appear realistic or appropriate for the model. Consider reflections, opacity, and overall fit.\n4. **3D Plausibility:** Determine if the model could exist in a three-dimensional space. Are all parts cohesive and do they make sense together?\n5. **Artifact-free:** Check for any irregularities, glitches, or unexpected artifacts.\n\nUse these aspects to determine a holistic score from 1 (Poor quality) to 5 (Good quality).
