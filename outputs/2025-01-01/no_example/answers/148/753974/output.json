However, here's how you can do it based on the criteria:\n\n### Material Quality Analysis:\n- **Metal Map:** Examine the metallic map to see if it appropriately distinguishes between metal and non-metal surfaces. A map that uses only a single color might indicate the absence of detail, resulting in a lower score.\n- **Roughness Map:** Assess whether the roughness map captures subtle surface variations. A high-quality roughness map will show detailed patterns and gradients, while a one-colored roughness map indicates a lack of detail.\n\n### Example Evaluation:\n- **Analysis:** The model primarily displays a single color on the metallic map, indicating a lack of distinct material regions.
