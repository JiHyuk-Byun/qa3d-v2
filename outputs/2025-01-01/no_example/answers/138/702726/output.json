However, I can help guide you on general factors to consider while evaluating 3D models:\n\n### Geometry Quality Analysis:\n- **Details and Fidelity**: Examine the intricacy of details present in the model. High-quality models should exhibit clear and complex details not possible with simpler shapes.\n- **Normal Map Accuracy**: Review the normal map for precision. It should accurately reflect the surface details without distortion.\n\nTo properly rate the target models based on these criteria, consider these steps:\n\n1. **Identify details in the RGB images**: Look for small, intricate design elements that indicate complexity.\n2. **Compare details in normal maps**: Ensure that the normal maps complement the depth and dimensions visible in the RGB images.\n3. **Primitive vs. Complex Forms**: Recognize primitive forms like simple cubes or spheres vs. intricate designs like human figures or cars.\n\nIf you have specific questions about interpreting these images, feel free to ask!",
