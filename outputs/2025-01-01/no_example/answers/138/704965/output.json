Check for:\n\n1. Proportion Accuracy \u2013 Ensure dimensions mimic real-world equivalents.\n2. Shape Realism \u2013 Assess for organic, natural shapes in living beings or appropriate geometric accuracy in man-made objects.\n3. Textural Fidelity \u2013 Look for realistic surface details and textures that contribute to a lifelike appearance.\n4. Structural Integrity \u2013 Check if all parts and components are appropriately aligned and placed.\n\n### Example Output Format\n\n```plaintext\nAnalysis: The given model exhibits [mention specific aspects like proportion, shape, texture etc.] that contribute to its realism. [Comment on strengths/weaknesses].\nScore: X\n```\n\n### Application\n\n1. Extract insight based on the description of the model provided above.\n2.

Look for realistic lighting and shadows.\n\n4. **3D Plausibility**: Consider the model's structural believability in a 3D space. Does it seem physically accurate and feasible?\n\n5. **Artifact-free**: Examine the model for glitches, noise, or visual artifacts that disrupt the visual integrity.\n\n### Scoring\nRate each category from 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Very Good) based on your observations, then average these scores for the final assessment.\n\nI can provide a template for your analysis:\n\n```plaintext\nAnalysis: The given object shows [brief evaluation for Geometry Quality], [brief evaluation for Texture Quality], [brief evaluation for Material Quality], [brief evaluation for 3",
