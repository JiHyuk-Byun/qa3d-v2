Are there complex curves and elements, or does it resemble more primitive shapes?\n   - **Accuracy**: Compare the normal map against the intended shape. A detailed and smooth normal map often indicates high-quality geometry.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\nFor a hypothetical model:\n\n**Geometry Quality Analysis**: The model displays intricate and detailed shapes, resembling complex figures rather than simple geometric forms. The normal map highlights these details effectively, indicating a high level of accuracy in capturing the intended form.\n\n**Score**: 5 (Very Good)\n\nApply this logic to your object and give a concise analysis followed by a score as per the above guide.",
