Our task is to determine the appropriate index for a given 3D model based on its quality relative to provided examples. The evaluation criteria is provided below.
We provide multi-view images of the 3D model, consisting of <|input_types|>.

# Criteria
<|instruction|>

# Question
Based on the given criteria, where does the target image fit among the sorted example images?
We will provide multi-view images of the examples, which are sorted in descending order according to the criteria.
If it is better than Image 0 or worse than Image 4, specify the appropriate position (0 if better than Image 0, and 5 if worse than Image 4).

# Output Format
Analysis: {analysis}
Index: {index}

# Output Example
1.
Analysis: The target image surpasses Image 0 in ..., because .... Therefore, its index is 0.
Index: 0

2.
Analysis: The target image is between Image i-1 and i, considering...
Index: i

3.
Analysis: The target image is better than Image i but worse than Image i+1, because...
Index: i+1

3.
Analysis: The given object is worse than Image 4 because...
Index: 5


Below are the example images and the target image.
Look at the 3D model from the multi-view images. Use the criteria above to evaluate the target object.
