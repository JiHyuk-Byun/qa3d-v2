Geometry Quality:  Evaluate the models based on the aspects of geometry quality, focusing on the details and accuracy of the normal map. The geometry should accurately represent the intended shape. 3D object having more fine-detailed shape must get higher ranking. Primitive shapes such as spheres, cylinders, and rectangular prisms are overly simplistic and therefore lack detailed geometry.
Texture Quality: Evaluate the model and on the aspects of texture quality. A high-quality textured 3D object exhibits a great level of detail in appearance and accurate color representation. Note high-frequency texture can be also seen as higly-fidelity texture in the context of appearance quality assessment. For example, an object whose overall color consists of only a single color can be said to have a texture lacking in detail.
Material Quality: Evaluate the accuracy and detail of an object's material representation using the metal map and roughness map. Metal Map defines metallic (value = 1) and non-metallic (value = 0) regions of a surface. Roughness Map describes surface irregularities, influencing how smooth or rough a material appears. A high-quality roughness map captures subtle variations that enhance realism. For example, a material map with more segmentation or fine-grained patterns can be considered a high-quality material map, whereas same colored clean material map can be considered no-detailed material map. Do not rely solely on the RGB image; instead, prioritize evaluation based on the material map.
Plausibility: Evaluate the model based on the aspects of 3D plausibility, focusing on how realistic its appearance and shape. An ideal model should possess accurate proportions, shapes, and structures that closely resemble the real-world object or scene.
Artifact-free:  Evaluate the 3D model based on the criterion of being artifact-free. Models that are clean in terms of geometry and texture, without artifacts or noise, should receive high scores. Conversely, 3D models that are low-poly or exhibit noisy or meaningless 3D structures should receive low scores.
Overall Preference: Considering all the criteria: Geometry Quality, Texture Quality, Material Quality, 3D Plausibility, Artifact-free, evaluate the target image.
